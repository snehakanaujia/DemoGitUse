        <h3> All aspects of health listed below are inter-related! Emotional and mental health are deeply
            connected, and the two also depend on physical health. Spiritual health is greatly related to emotional and
            mental health as well!</h3>

        <h3>Similarly, all aspects of health are subjective. What works for someone may not work for you! The trick
            is staying patient and trying new things with an open mind until you find techniques that work for you.</h3>

        <h3> Physical </h3>

        <p>Some possible ways to take care of physical health is staying hydrated (repetitive advice, but useful!), getting a
            good amount of sleep (at least 5! Looking at you, college students), and keeping yourself physically
            active (a quick walk around an area on campus, or doing exercises found online/recommended to you by a physician)</p>

        <h3> Emotional </h3>

        <p>Being emotionally healthy means managing and being mindful of your emotions, good or bad! Purposely
            trying to be aware of your emotions (and the why's of it) can help you understand and manage them
            in the future. Taking the time to balance fulfilling responsibilities with things you enjoy
            and connecting with/meeting other people can make all the difference! (Humans are primarily
            social creatures...)</p>

        <h3> Mental </h3>

        <p>If you have medication, take them! If you have a therapist, usually listen to them!
            The power of having someone to talk/vent to about really anything is amazing, and can
            really unmess your head. Ask for help when you need it - even islands aren't completely
            self-sufficient. Take care of your brain!</p>

        <h3> Spiritual </h3>

        <p>Take a step back from the hustle and bustle of life. Remind yourself of the place you hold
            in your community, your nation, the cosmos. You're a living, breathing, self-conscious
            manifestation of the universe! Isn't that so cool! Reminding yourself of the bigger
            picture (Universe-wise, religion-wise, or otherwise) can greatly improve spiritual health!</p>
