# MHCHealthAppliction

This is a mobile health application with features that can aid in recording health details of one's experience: a health checklist 
(what aspects of your health did you focus on today), a journaling entry section (utilizes SQLite database to keep a record), 
a gratitude entry and affirmations section, and a resources list for more health information.
